Cell House Roof
You've arrived at the Cell House Roof! It is quiet and hidden with no sign of guards or anyone around. Seems like a great place to hide things and plan your escape. The air vent is the only way back out. The only noticable features around are sky lights, drain pipes, and the air vent.
