Warden Office
You've arrived at the Warden Office! What a messy office. The warden must be a slob. The only way in and out is east toward the Recreation Yard. You see a desk in the middle of the office and a sleeping warden behind it. Better not wake him up. There is also a bookshelf and a bird cage in the corner.
