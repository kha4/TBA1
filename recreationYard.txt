Recreation Yard
You've arrived at the Recreation Yard! Not the most fun place to spend free time in. The dreary weather isn't helping much either. From here, the Library is to the north, the Yard is to the east, and the Warden Office is to the West. There are thick and sturdy walls surrounding the entire area making sure no one can get in or out. There is also a horseshoe pit for prisons to play.
You're back at the Recreation Yard. Passageways: North - Library, East - Yard, West - Warden Office. Features: Walls, Horseshoe Pit.
